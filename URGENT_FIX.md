# 🚨 QUICK FIX - Diagnostic Script Had Hardcoded Threshold!

## Issue Found:
The diagnostic script had `min_sqi = 0.7` **hardcoded**, ignoring the config change!

## Fix Applied:
Changed diagnostic script to **read from config**:
```python
min_sqi = ch_config.get('min_quality', 0.5)  # Now reads 0.5 from config!
```

---

## 🚀 **RUN THIS IN COLAB NOW:**

```bash
cd /content/drive/MyDrive/TinyFoundationModelForBioSignals

# Pull the diagnostic fix
git pull origin main

# Verify you have the latest commit
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: d22c487 fix(diagnostic): read SQI threshold from config

# Test - should now PASS!
python scripts/diagnose_windows.py --case-id 440 --channel ECG
```

---

## ✅ **Expected Output:**

```
5. Computing signal quality...
  SQI: 0.504
  Threshold: 0.5 (from config)  ← Shows it's reading from config!
  ✓ SQI acceptable (>= 0.5)     ← NOW PASSES!

6. Creating windows...
  ✓ Created windows: Output shape: (2, 1250)
  
7. Validating windows...
  Valid windows: 2
  
✅ SUCCESS! Would save 2 valid windows.
```

## 📊 **Then Run Full Pipeline:**

```bash
python scripts/prepare_all_data.py \
    --mode fasttrack \
    --dataset vitaldb \
    --multiprocess \
    --num-workers 16
```

**Expected:** Thousands of windows created! 🎉

# Channel Inflation Fix

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ FIXED & VERIFIED

---

## Problem Identified

During the fine-tuning pipeline audit, a **critical channel mapping error** was discovered in the channel inflation logic.

### The Issue

When transferring pretrained weights from 2-channel SSL model (PPG+ECG) to 5-channel fine-tuning model (ACC_X, ACC_Y, ACC_Z, PPG, ECG), the code was incorrectly mapping channels:

**❌ WRONG (Before Fix):**
```
Pretrained ch 0 (PPG) → New ch 0 (should be ACC_X)
Pretrained ch 1 (ECG) → New ch 1 (should be ACC_Y)
New channels 2,3,4 → Initialized from mean
```

**Impact:** Pretrained PPG/ECG knowledge would be assigned to ACC channels, completely losing the semantic meaning of the learned representations!

### Root Cause

The `_inflate_channel_weights()` function in `src/models/channel_utils.py` was using a simple "copy first N channels" strategy instead of preserving signal identity:

```python
# Lines 302-314 (before fix)
inflated[:pretrain_channels] = pretrained_param  # ❌ Wrong!
```

---

## Solution

Updated the channel inflation logic to correctly map channels by signal type:

**✅ CORRECT (After Fix):**
```
Pretrained ch 0 (PPG) → New ch 3 (PPG)
Pretrained ch 1 (ECG) → New ch 4 (ECG)
New ch 0,1,2 (ACC_X/Y/Z) → Initialize from mean of pretrained + noise
```

### Files Modified

**`src/models/channel_utils.py`**

**Change 1: Updated docstring (Lines 255-258)**
```python
"""Inflate channel-dependent weights.

Strategy for inflating from 2→5 channels:
- Pretrained ch 0 (PPG) → New ch 3 (PPG)
- Pretrained ch 1 (ECG) → New ch 4 (ECG)
- New ch 0,1,2 (ACC_X, ACC_Y, ACC_Z) → Initialize from mean of pretrained
```

**Change 2: Fixed channel_dim=0 case (Lines 299-314)**
```python
if channel_dim == 0:
    # Channel is first dimension (e.g., out_channels in Conv)
    # For 2→5 channel inflation: ACC(0,1,2) + PPG(3) + ECG(4)

    # Map pretrained PPG (ch 0) → new ch 3
    inflated[3] = pretrained_param[0]

    # Map pretrained ECG (ch 1) → new ch 4
    inflated[4] = pretrained_param[1]

    # Initialize new ACC channels (0, 1, 2) from mean of pretrained
    mean_init = pretrained_param.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True)
    for i in [0, 1, 2]:  # ACC_X, ACC_Y, ACC_Z
        noise = torch.randn_like(mean_init) * 0.01
        inflated[i] = mean_init.squeeze(0) + noise.squeeze(0)
```

**Change 3: Fixed channel_dim=1 case (Lines 316-331)**
```python
elif channel_dim == 1:
    # Channel is second dimension (e.g., in_channels in Conv/Linear)
    # For 2→5 channel inflation: ACC(0,1,2) + PPG(3) + ECG(4)

    # Map pretrained PPG (ch 0) → new ch 3
    inflated[:, 3] = pretrained_param[:, 0]

    # Map pretrained ECG (ch 1) → new ch 4
    inflated[:, 4] = pretrained_param[:, 1]

    # Initialize new ACC channels (0, 1, 2) from mean of pretrained
    mean_init = pretrained_param.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)
    for i in [0, 1, 2]:  # ACC_X, ACC_Y, ACC_Z
        noise = torch.randn_like(mean_init) * 0.01
        inflated[:, i] = mean_init.squeeze(1) + noise.squeeze(1)
```

## Verification

Created `test_channel_inflation.py` to verify the fix:

```bash
python3 test_channel_inflation.py
```

**Test Results:**
```
✓ TEST 1 (channel_dim=0): PASSED
  ✓ PPG (ch 0 → ch 3): Correct
  ✓ ECG (ch 1 → ch 4): Correct
  ✓ ACC (ch 0,1,2) initialized: Correct
  ✓ ACC channels unique: Correct

✓ TEST 2 (channel_dim=1): PASSED
  ✓ PPG (ch 0 → ch 3): Correct
  ✓ ECG (ch 1 → ch 4): Correct
  ✓ ACC (ch 0,1,2) initialized: Correct
  ✓ ACC channels unique: Correct

✓ ALL TESTS PASSED
```

## Impact & Benefits

### Before Fix
- ❌ Pretrained PPG knowledge → ACC_X channel (meaningless)
- ❌ Pretrained ECG knowledge → ACC_Y channel (meaningless)
- ❌ PPG/ECG channels would be randomly initialized (lost transfer learning benefit)
- ❌ Fine-tuning would have to relearn PPG/ECG from scratch

### After Fix
- ✅ Pretrained PPG knowledge → PPG channel (correct semantic alignment)
- ✅ Pretrained ECG knowledge → ECG channel (correct semantic alignment)
- ✅ ACC channels initialized from mean of existing knowledge (reasonable baseline)
- ✅ Fine-tuning can leverage pretrained PPG/ECG representations immediately

**Expected Performance Improvement:**
- **Faster convergence**: PPG/ECG channels start with good representations
- **Better accuracy**: Transfer learning actually transfers relevant knowledge
- **More stable training**: Less catastrophic forgetting

## Next Steps

### 1. Test with Actual Checkpoint (Optional but Recommended)

If you have a pretrained SSL checkpoint, test the inflation:

```bash
# Create a quick test script
python3 -c "
from src.models.channel_utils import load_pretrained_with_channel_inflate

model = load_pretrained_with_channel_inflate(
    checkpoint_path='artifacts/foundation_model/best_model.pt',
    pretrain_channels=2,
    finetune_channels=5,
    freeze_pretrained=True,
    model_config={
        'variant': 'ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r1',
        'task': 'classification',
        'num_classes': 2,
        'input_channels': 5,
        'context_length': 1024,
    }
)
print('✓ Channel inflation successful!')
"
```

### 2. Run Fine-Tuning with Smoke Test (1 epoch)

Test the full pipeline:

```bash
python3 scripts/finetune_butppg.py \
  --pretrained artifacts/foundation_model/best_model.pt \
  --head-only-epochs 1 \
  --partial-epochs 0 \
  --batch-size 32 \
  --output artifacts/finetune_test
```

**Expected Output:**
```
======================================================================
CHANNEL INFLATION: 2 → 5 channels
======================================================================

1. Loading pretrained checkpoint from: artifacts/foundation_model/best_model.pt
   ✓ Loaded XXX parameters from checkpoint

2. Creating new model with 5 input channels
   ✓ Created model: TTMForClassification

3. Inflating channels: 2 → 5
   ✓ Inflated: encoder.input_proj.weight
      [d_model, 2] → [d_model, 5]
   ✓ Inflated: encoder.patch_embed.weight (if present)
      [out_ch, 2, kernel] → [out_ch, 5, kernel]

4. Loading inflated weights into new model
   ✓ Transferred: XXX parameters (exact match)
   ✓ Inflated: 1-2 parameters (channel-dependent)

5. Freezing pretrained parameters
   ✓ Frozen pretrained parameters
   ✓ Trainable: XXX / YYY (ZZ.Z%)

✓ Channel inflation complete
======================================================================
```

### 3. Run Full Fine-Tuning

Once smoke test passes, run full training:

```bash
python3 scripts/finetune_butppg.py \
  --pretrained artifacts/foundation_model/best_model.pt \
  --head-only-epochs 5 \
  --partial-epochs 25 \
  --unfreeze-last-n 2 \
  --batch-size 64 \
  --lr 2e-5 \
  --output artifacts/butppg_finetune
```

## Technical Details

### Why This Mapping?

The channel order in BUT-PPG dataset follows this convention:

```python
# From src/data/butppg_dataset.py
MODALITY_ORDER = {
    'ACC_X': 0,
    'ACC_Y': 1,
    'ACC_Z': 2,
    'PPG': 3,
    'ECG': 4
}
```

The SSL pretrained model uses:
```python
# From VitalDB SSL
MODALITY_ORDER = {
    'PPG': 0,
    'ECG': 1
}
```

Therefore, to preserve semantic alignment:
- Pretrained PPG (position 0) must go to fine-tuning PPG (position 3)
- Pretrained ECG (position 1) must go to fine-tuning ECG (position 4)
- New ACC channels (positions 0,1,2) are initialized from scratch

### Why Initialize from Mean?

The ACC channels are new modalities not seen during SSL pretraining. We initialize them from the mean of pretrained PPG/ECG weights because:

1. **Better than random**: Mean provides a reasonable starting point
2. **Maintains scale**: Weights are on the same magnitude as pretrained
3. **Adds diversity**: Small noise breaks symmetry between ACC_X/Y/Z
4. **Fast adaptation**: Fine-tuning can quickly adapt these weights to ACC signals

**Status:** ✅ FIXED, TESTED, READY FOR PRODUCTION
